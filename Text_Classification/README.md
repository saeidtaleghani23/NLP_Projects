# Text Classification Project

## Introduction

**Text Classification** is a method of mapping a document, such as a social media post, email, or news article, to a predefined category or class. This is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), used in various real-world applications such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic classification.

There are three main types of text classification problems:

- **Binary Classification**: This involves two possible classes. For example, in sentiment analysis, the task could be to classify text as **positive** or **negative**.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: This involves more than two classes, and the classes are **mutually exclusive**. For example, a news article can be classified into one of several categories such as **sports**, **politics**, **entertainment**, etc.
- **Multi-Label Classification**: In this case, a document can belong to multiple classes simultaneously. For example, a news article may be related to both **sports** and **politics**, which means it receives **more than one label**.

### Example Use Cases:
- **Sentiment Analysis (Binary Classification)**: Classifying text into **positive** or **negative** sentiment.
- **Topic Classification (Multi-Class Classification)**: Categorizing news articles into topics like **sports**, **technology**, **politics**, etc.
- **Tagging (Multi-Label Classification)**: A news article can be tagged with multiple labels such as **sports**, **politics**, and **entertainment**.
